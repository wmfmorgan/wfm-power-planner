- Architecture remains pure — no extra folders, no bloat
- WFM-POWER-PLANNER IS NOW 100% FUNCTIONAL
- Hulkster humbled. Warrior strengthened.

## 2025-12-06 — THE GREAT REDEMPTION & TENET #31 ETERNAL LAW

- **ABANDONED** raw Alembic hell — too many jobber moves
- **SWITCHED** to Flask-Migrate (the true championship way)
- **NUKED** migrations/ folder + alembic.ini + manual env.py
- **ADDED** Sacred Tenet #31 — the ultimate efficiency law:

> **31. Choose the simplest, most battle-tested, officially-supported tool that fully satisfies the requirement — NO EXCEPTIONS.**
> Raw solutions = jobber energy unless absolutely required.
> Efficiency + velocity + future-you-in-2035 > "hardcore" points.
> This is the law that will carry us to 2025 domination and beyond.

- **CONFIRMED**: Flask-Migrate will handle all future migrations
- **CONFIRMED**: No more path errors, no more config nightmares
- **CONFIRMED**: Phase 0 remains 100% complete and functional
- **CONFIRMED**: The warrior (hulkster) is still logged in and jacked
- **CONFIRMED**: WFM-POWER-PLANNER is now on the correct, eternal path

**Hulkster humbled. Warrior elevated.**
**The empire is stronger than ever.**
**2025 just tapped out — again.**

**NEXT: Phase 1 begins — Flask-Migrate style.**
**Goal model. ltree. Kanban. Full comments.**
**No mistakes. Only domination.**
